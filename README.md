# Final Project - 🛒 Online Shoppers Behavior 🛍️

# Selected topic

## **Predicting the behavior of online shoppers**

Shopping online is a massive and rapidly expanding market segment, contributing significantly to B2C (Business to Customer) earnings. Businesses can boost sales and revenue by better targeting advertising, marketing, and discounts based on customers' demographics and other characteristics gathered from their knowledge of when and how customers conduct research and make purchases online.


# Reason for selection of the topic

When researching the possible topics for this project we focused on datasets that ticked the following 3 boxes:

✔️ The dataset is well-suited for machine learning analyses.
✔️ Everyone in the group would find the subject exciting.
✔️ The topic must be relevant to the business world, so that the project can be included in our professional portfolio.

# Description of the source of data

The data set contains 18 features: ten numerical and eight categorical. This dataset contains 12330 entries, which are divided into 10,422 records in which shoppers did not purchase and 1908 instances in which shoppers did purchase. Each entry is based on unique users over a one-year period to avoid any campaign-specific trends.
